## EL7041-0052
Test "high speed" with EL7041-0052 and a phytron motor.
The setup uses el7041:s highest speed range (32000 fullsteps/s)

# Conclusion
Running a stepper without mechnics with EL7052-0052 over 600 fullsteps/s is almost impossible. An inertia is needed and damper is needed.
Attaching a damper and inertia allows very high speeds, tested up to 26000 fullsteps/s (130Hz (turns/s)).
